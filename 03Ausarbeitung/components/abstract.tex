This work is about bash scripts analyzing flat files (commonly known as CSV files) that will be compared to SQL queries doing the same on relational databases.\\

Methods for analyzing data will be tested on their efficiency and how they could be a\-dap\-ted for use with relational databases.
That is why some useful familiar unix command line tools as well as newer innovations using the command line will be presented.
But in the end, it shows the disadvantage of common scripts in fields of duration and maintainability.\\

The first goal is a implementation of the TPC-H benchmark only using unix command line tools, afterwards a bash to SQL converter will be presented, which makes query processing on flat file databases much easier.\\

As a result of performance tests using TPC-H benchmarks, times about up to 15 minutes for processing a query, command line tools should be replaced by an equivalent SQL query.\\

The presented Bash2SQL compiler converts each command to SQL statements and con\-nects SQL queries, where their origin commands are in one pipeline. The produced SQL query can stand alone or be embedded in a new bash script.

%Performance tests on query processing on flat file databases using bash and on modern relational databases using SQL and developing a Bash to SQL compiler to substitute command line tools
